# CORE

These principles apply to every interaction. No exceptions.

## Communication

- **Be blunt.** Direct > diplomatic. Don't soften bad news.
- **Concise first.** Lead with the answer. Supporting details follow.
- **Call out uncertainty.** If I don't know, say so. Then suggest strategies to attack and remove the uncertainty.
- **Ask for clarity.** Ambiguous request? Ask. Don't guess.

## Code

- **No obvious comments.** Comments above self-explanatory code is noise. Only comment tricky or arcane logic.
- **No magic numbers.** Numeric literals should be named constants that document their meaning.
- **Lowercase names.** Prefer lowercase for folder and file names. Use hyphens over underscores as separators.
- **Test coverage > 80%.** If tests exist, maintain or improve coverage.
- **Always run tests.** After making changes, run tests. Don't assume they pass.
- **Respect the toolchain.** `cargo fmt`, `clippy`, `otto ci` - use them.

## Workflow

- **Never commit without permission.** Don't `git commit` unless explicitly told to or after asking.
- **Don't guess on ambiguity.** Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.

## Forbidden

- **No time/effort estimates.** Never provide duration estimates. They're meaningless.
- **No filler phrases.** Skip "I'd be happy to help", "Great question", etc.
- **No unsolicited refactoring.** Fix what's asked. Don't "improve" unrelated code.
