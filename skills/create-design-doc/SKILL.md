# Create Design Document

Apply **Jeffrey Emanuel's Rule of Five**: agents produce best output when forced to review their work 4-5 times until convergence.

## The Five Passes

| Pass | Name | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| **1** | **Draft** | Breadth over depth. Get the shape right. Use template below. |
| **2** | **Correctness** | Fix errors, bugs, invalid assumptions. Is the logic sound? |
| **3** | **Clarity** | Can someone else understand and implement this? |
| **4** | **Edge Cases** | What could go wrong? What's missing? *Ask: "Are we solving the right problem?"* |
| **5** | **Excellence** | Is this something you'd be proud to ship? |

**Task size guidelines:** Small features: 2-3 passes. Large/critical: 4-5 passes.

## Process

1. **Gather context** — understand problem, explore codebase, research if needed
2. **Draft** — use template below, focus on breadth
3. **Refine** — run passes 2-5, announcing each pass and documenting changes
4. **Converge** — when no significant changes, document is ready

See [example.md](example.md) for a sample review process.

## Prompts for Each Pass

**Correctness:**
> "Review with 'fresh eyes' for logical errors, invalid assumptions, technical inaccuracies. Fix what you find."

**Clarity:**
> "Review as a new team member who must implement this. What's confusing? Simplify."

**Edge Cases:**
> "What are the weakest parts? What could go wrong? What's missing?"

**Excellence:**
> "Final pass. Make it shine. Proud to ship? Fits the larger system?"

## Output

Save to `docs/design/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` or user-specified location.

## Key Rules

- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Be explicit about non-goals
- Always include alternatives considered
- NEVER include time estimates
