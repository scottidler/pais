# Modern Tools Inventory

Track modern replacements for classic Unix tools installed on this system.

## Usage

- `/modern-tools` - Scan system and display current inventory
- `/modern-tools scan` - Rescan and update the inventory file
- `/modern-tools missing` - Show recommended tools not yet installed

## Inventory Location

`~/.config/pais/modern-tools.yaml`

## Tool Mappings

Scan for these modern replacements:

| Classic | Modern | Check Locations |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| ls | eza, exa, lsd | cargo, system |
| cat | bat, batcat | cargo, system |
| grep | rg (ripgrep) | cargo, system |
| find | fd, fdfind | cargo, system |
| cd | zoxide | cargo |
| sed | sd | cargo |
| du | dust, ncdu | cargo, system |
| df | duf | cargo, system |
| diff | delta | cargo, system |
| ps | procs | cargo |
| top | btop, bottom, ytop, htop | cargo, system |
| man | tldr | cargo |
| curl | xh, httpie | cargo, system |
| ping | gping | cargo |
| wc (code) | tokei | cargo |
| cut | choose | cargo |
| xxd | hexyl | cargo |
| time | hyperfine | cargo |

## Scan Locations

1. `~/.cargo/bin/` - Rust tools installed via cargo
2. System PATH via `which` - System-installed tools
3. `~/.local/bin/` - User-local installs
4. Mise-managed tools via `mise list`

## Inventory Format

```yaml
# ~/.config/pais/modern-tools.yaml
generated: 2026-01-04T12:00:00Z
tools:
  eza:
    replaces: ls
    location: ~/.cargo/bin/eza
  rg:
    replaces: grep
    location: ~/.cargo/bin/rg
  zoxide:
    replaces: cd
    location: ~/.cargo/bin/zoxide
missing:
  - name: hyperfine
    replaces: time
    install: cargo install hyperfine
  - name: choose
    replaces: cut
    install: cargo install choose
```

## Scan Procedure

1. For each tool in the mappings table:
   - Check `~/.cargo/bin/<tool>`
   - Check `which <tool>`
2. Write findings to inventory file
3. Report summary: installed count, missing count
