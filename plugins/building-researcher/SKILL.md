# Building Researcher

Research construction and DIY projects by searching YouTube, building forums, and contractor resources. Use this skill when the user wants to:
- Learn building techniques and methods
- Research tool selection and usage
- Find material specifications and options
- Understand building codes and permits
- Plan project sequences and timelines
- Troubleshoot construction problems

## Output Storage

**Always save research results to:**

```
~/.config/pais/research/building/<topic>/<date>.md
```

- `<topic>`: lowercase, hyphenated topic name (e.g., `shed-foundation`, `electrical-rough-in`, `deck-framing`)
- `<date>`: ISO date format `YYYY-MM-DD`

Create the directory if it doesn't exist before writing.

## Research Process

### 1. YouTube Search (Primary Source)

YouTube is the primary source for building research:

```
"<topic>" DIY tutorial
"<topic>" how to build
"<topic>" step by step
"<topic>" pro tips
"<topic>" common mistakes
"<topic>" building code
```

**Top YouTube Channels:**

**General Construction:**
- Essential Craftsman (Scott Wadsworth) - fundamentals, wisdom
- Matt Risinger - building science, best practices
- This Old House - techniques, problem-solving
- Home RenoVision DIY - practical tutorials

**Framing/Carpentry:**
- The Honest Carpenter
- Perkins Builder Brothers
- Larry Haun (classic framing)

**Electrical:**
- Electrician U
- How To Home
- Sparky Channel

**Plumbing:**
- Roger Wakefield
- Got2Learn

**Finish Work:**
- Finish Carpentry TV
- The Craftsman Blog

### 2. Web Search for Specifications

```
"<topic>" building code requirements
"<topic>" material specifications
"<topic>" best practices <current-year>
"<material>" installation guide
"<tool>" how to use properly
```

### 3. Key Sources to Prioritize

**Codes & Standards:**
- ICC (International Code Council)
- Local building department websites
- NEC (electrical code)
- UPC/IPC (plumbing codes)

**Building Science:**
- Building Science Corporation (buildingscience.com)
- Fine Homebuilding
- Journal of Light Construction

**DIY Communities:**
- r/HomeImprovement
- r/DIY
- Contractor Talk forums
- GardenWeb/Houzz forums

**Manufacturer Resources:**
- Simpson Strong-Tie (connectors)
- Tyvek/Dupont (housewrap)
- LP/Advantech (sheathing)
- Individual product install guides

### 4. Apply Fabric Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `extract_wisdom` | Extract tips from contractor videos |
| `extract_recommendations` | Pull tool and material recommendations |
| `summarize_paper` | Summarize technical building documents |
| `compare_and_contrast` | Compare material/tool options |

## Project Categories

### Structural
- Foundation types (concrete, pier, slab)
- Framing (walls, roof, floor)
- Load-bearing considerations
- Connections and fasteners

### Exterior
- Siding and trim
- Roofing
- Windows and doors
- Waterproofing

### Systems
- Electrical (circuits, panels, outlets)
- Plumbing (supply, drain, venting)
- HVAC basics
- Insulation

### Interior
- Drywall
- Flooring
- Trim and finish
- Painting

### Outbuildings
- Sheds
