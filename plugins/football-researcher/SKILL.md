- Research practice drills and techniques
- Study opponent tendencies or game film concepts
- Discover age-appropriate coaching methods
- Find coaching clinics and resources

## Output Storage

```
~/.config/pais/research/football/<date>/<topic>.md
```

- `<date>`: ISO date format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `<topic>`: lowercase, hyphenated topic name (e.g., `wing-t-series`, `cover-3-beaters`, `youth-tackling-drills`)
