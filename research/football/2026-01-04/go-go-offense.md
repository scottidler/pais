## Summary

The Go-Go Offense is an innovative offensive scheme developed by Brennan Marion that combines old-school triple-option principles with modern spread concepts. Despite operating from shotgun formations, Marion explicitly states: "We are not a spread offense. We are not 10 personnel air raid." The philosophy is built around "21 personnel trying to run through you and throw it over your head."

The offense emphasizes physicality, tempo, and deception. It uses unique formations (particularly two-back sets) to create pre-snap confusion while maintaining a balanced attack. The name originated when Marion was living on Florida Ave. near Howard University, hearing Chuck Brown's go-go music, and decided "This is that GoGo stuff."

Marion developed the scheme while coaching high school football, taking a 1-9 team to the playoffs in his first season. He has since brought it to the college level at Howard, William & Mary, UNLV (where it earned them their first national ranking since 1978), Sacramento State, and now Colorado under Deion Sanders.

## Philosophy: The Five V's

The Go-Go Offense is built on five core principles:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Value** | Value the ball - protect the football |
| **Violent** | Be physical - "how you play without the ball determines how you love your teammates" |
| **Vertical** | Attack downfield - stretch the defense |
| **Variety** | Multiple formations, motions, and personnel groupings |
| **Victory** | Win - put the "V" in Vegas |

---

## Personnel Packages

Unlike modern spread offenses, the Go-Go rejects 10/11 personnel. Instead, it majors in heavier groupings:

| Personnel | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **20 Personnel** | 2 RBs, 0 TEs, 3 WRs |
| **21 Personnel** | 2 RBs, 1 TE, 2 WRs |
| **Pony** | Two true running backs (not fullback-based) |
| **12 Personnel** | 1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs |
| **Bigs Package** | 8 offensive linemen on the field |

**Key distinction**: Unlike most 20/21 personnel teams, Marion does NOT use a traditional fullback. Both backs are true running backs who must be solid pass catchers and run blockers.

---

## Key Formations

### Sidecar Formation
The signature look - QB in shotgun with BOTH running backs aligned to the same side, creating a "three-headed monster" in the backfield without sacrificing passing game.

### FAR/NEAR Alignments
- **FAR**: Both RBs on opposite side from TE/slot
- **NEAR**: Both RBs on same side as TE/slot

### Pistol Variations
- One back in pistol behind QB, another even with QB to right/left
- 30 personnel: Deep back in pistol, two up backs behind tackles (bodies perpendicular to LOS)

### Unbalanced Sets
Heavy use of unbalanced formations to create confusion. Many defenses will still cover the ineligible receiver, leaving one less defender to fill a gap.

---

## Run Game

### Primary Run Schemes

| Play | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Wide Zone** | Zone | Marion's bread and butter - "the one" |
| **Inside Zone** | Zone | Various looks and formations |
| **Duo** | Gap | Double teams + H-back kicks out last man |
| **Counter** | Gap | GT/GY counter variations |
| **Toss Sweep** | Edge | 38 Toss Sweep concept |
| **Dive Option** | Option | 32 Dive Option |
| **Lead** | Power | 32 Lead, 32 Lead Insert |

### Triple Option Foundation

At its heart, the Go-Go is built around the triple option:

**Zone Scheme Options**:
1. Hand off to RB
2. QB keeper
3. Pitch to trailing back

**Gap Scheme Options**:
1. Pass
2. Run (handoff)
3. Keep

**Key Insight**: Marion insists mobile quarterbacks aren't required. The mere THREAT of the option creates defensive vulnerabilities. UNLV's 2023 starter Jayden Maiava ran a 5.24 40-yard dash - not fast - but the system still worked.

### Pin-Pull Concept
From two-back sets:
- TE blocks down and pins the defender
- Pulling back seals the edge
- Lead back kicks out

---

## Passing Game

### Philosophy
All downfield shots tie directly to specific run plays, maximizing confusion. By faking wide zone before throwing deep, Marion creates geometric angles that isolate receivers downfield.

### Key Pass Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **H Cross** | Crossing route combinations |
| **Post Corner** | Deep route combo |
| **Flood X Cross** | Flood concept with crossing element |
| **Mesh** | Classic mesh routes |
| **Stick** | Quick game |
| **Trail** | Combination route |
| **GH Slip** | Tight end/back release |
| **Z Middle Screen** | Screen game |

### Movement & Drop Back
Uses receiver over-routes to recapture safeties. Develops protection/pass-point reads with receiver options.

---

## RPO System

The Go-Go incorporates sophisticated RPOs with up to FOUR options:

1. **Pre-snap read** (bubble throw)
2. **Post-snap read** (handoff)
3. **Keeper** (QB run)
4. **Late pitch** (option pitch)

This creates a 4-way decision tree for the QB on a single play.

---

## Tempo & Communication

### Sugar Huddle / No Huddle
The offense operates at high tempo, preventing defenses from adjusting personnel or coverage.

### Simplified Play Calling
Marion's process:
1. **Spring**: Teach quarterbacks verbose West Coast terminology
2. **Summer**: QBs condense plays into ONE-WORD calls with their own names/signals
3. **Fall**: Streamlined communication allows rapid-fire play calls

---

## Coaching Points

- **Selfless Play**: "How you play without the ball determines how you love your teammates"
- Even receivers must be willing blockers (WR Ricky White praised as "the best blocker on the team")
- Run the ball where the defense isn't - use unbalanced sets to create numerical advantages
- Tempo prevents defensive substitution and adjustment
- Mobile QB not required - just the THREAT of QB run creates hesitation
- Two backs creates "three-headed monster" without sacrificing passing game

## Practice Drills

| Drill | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Duo rep work | Gap scheme execution | Focus on double teams |
| Wide zone footwork | Zone blocking fundamentals | Lateral steps, combo blocks |
| Triple option mesh | QB-RB timing | All three options |
| Tempo periods | Practice at game speed | No-huddle execution |
| WR blocking | Perimeter blocking | Emphasized heavily |

---

## Install Progression

Based on Marion's approach:

1. **Day 1-3**: Base personnel alignment (20/21), sidecar formation, FAR/NEAR
2. **Day 4-6**: Wide zone from multiple looks, inside zone variations
3. **Day 7-9**: Duo/Counter gap schemes, basic triple option reads
4. **Day 10-12**: RPO additions (2-way, then 3-way, then 4-way reads)
5. **Day 13-15**: Passing concepts tied to run action
6. **Day 16+**: Tempo installation, one-word call system

## Results & Track Record

| Team | Year | Results |
|------|------|---------|

| Waynesboro Area HS | - | League title share after 0-10 prior year |
| Howard | 2017 | Top 25 scoring/offense, upset 45-point favorite UNLV |
| William & Mary | - | Nearly doubled point production, +100 yards/game |
| UNLV | 2023 | First national ranking since 1978, 34.4 PPG |

## Age-Appropriate Modifications

For youth/JV implementation:

- **Simplify personnel**: Stick to 21 personnel base
- **Reduce formations**: Focus on sidecar and standard pistol
- **Limit reads**: Start with 2-way RPOs before progressing
- **Emphasize fundamentals**: Zone blocking footwork, ball security, pitch mechanics
- **Tempo considerations**: Slower tempo initially, build up as execution improves
- **QB requirements**: Works with non-mobile QBs - teach decision-making over athleticism
