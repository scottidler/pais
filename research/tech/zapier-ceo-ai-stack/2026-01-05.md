## Key Topics Covered

### 1. AI Adoption Leadership

- CEOs often fall into the "delegation trap" - writing AI memos but not personally engaging
- Leaders must do hackathons, show-and-tells, and create "play spaces" for teams
- "Don't be a robot, build a robot" - Zapier's core value
- Once people put their hands on the tools, the fear goes away

### 2. Extracting Company Culture with AI

- Uses **Granola** (meeting recorder) to capture all meetings
- Runs prompts on meeting transcripts to extract "unspoken company culture"
- Compares actual behavior against stated values
- Can identify gaps between what companies say and how they actually operate
- Output can be used for job descriptions, hiring rubrics, and performance evaluation

### 3. AI Interview Evaluation Agent

- Built a Zapier agent that evaluates interview transcripts automatically
- Triggers when notes are added to Granola interview folder
- Evaluates candidates against job description + company values
- Provides yes/no/maybe recommendation with reasoning
- Acts as a bias check and thought partner
- Enhancement ideas:
  - Evaluate interviewer quality during the session
  - Put yes/no/maybe in email subject line for faster action

### 4. Talent Sourcing with Grok

- Uses Grok to find "diamonds in the rough" on X/Twitter
- Natural language queries beat LinkedIn's boolean search
- Can filter by: follower count, location, engagement type, avatar authenticity
- Great for influencer marketing and product feedback sourcing
- Helps find talent segments that traditional recruiting misses

## Key Insights

| Insight | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Economic Viability** | AI enables tasks that were previously "not economically valuable" - too expensive or tedious for humans |
| **AI Coaching** | "AI is this infinitely patient coach" - no power dynamics preventing honest feedback |
| **SOPs = Agents** | "If you've ever seen standard operating procedures, you've seen an agent" |
| **Ideation > Implementation** | The challenge is coming up with ideas - implementation takes seconds with copilot |
| **Talent Competition** | Top talent is still competitive everywhere; hyper-specialized single-task roles face displacement |
